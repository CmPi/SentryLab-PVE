Title: SentryLab-PVE

A lightweight monitoring stack for Proxmox VE hosts. Collects system, storage, ZFS, NVMe wear/SMART metrics and publishes them to MQTT for Home Assistant (and ESPHome displays). Tested on Proxmox VE 9.1.4.

## Highlights
- Split collectors: system, temp, wear, health, zfs, non-zfs; orchestrated by active/passive runners.
- Systemd timers for clean scheduling; start/stop helpers provided.
- Safe SMART usage to avoid waking sleeping devices (active cycle only).
- MQTT discovery for Home Assistant; CSV exports for quick hardware mapping.
- ESPHome example (Witty Cloud) for visual alerts.

```

## Prerequisites
- MQTT broker and Home Assistant
- Proxmox host with bash + systemd
- Packages: `git`, `jq`, `mosquitto-clients`
```bash
apt update && apt install -y git jq mosquitto-clients
```

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CmPi/SentryLab-PVE.git
cd SentryLab-PVE
sudo ./install.sh
```
Installer targets:
- Scripts: `/usr/local/bin/sentrylab/`
- Config: `/usr/local/etc/sentrylab.conf`
- Units: copied to `/usr/local/bin/sentrylab/system/` (deployed to `/etc/systemd/system/` only when `start.sh` is used, removed when `stop.sh` is used, subject to backup)
- CSV exports: `/var/lib/sentrylab/exports/`

## Configure
Edit `/usr/local/etc/sentrylab.conf`:
- `BROKER`, `PORT`, `USER`, `PASS`
- `HOST_NAME` (defaults to hostname)
- Optional: `MQTT_QOS`, `HA_BASE_TOPIC`, `DEBUG=true` for dry-run

## Quick Tests (DEBUG=true)
```bash
# Discovery (HA configs only)
DEBUG=true /usr/local/bin/sentrylab/discovery.sh

# Passive set (no wake): system + non-zfs
DEBUG=true /usr/local/bin/sentrylab/monitor-passive.sh

# Active set (may wake drives): temp, wear, health, zfs, non-zfs
DEBUG=true /usr/local/bin/sentrylab/monitor-active.sh
```
Set `DEBUG=false` to publish for real.

## Automate (systemd)
```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/sentrylab/start.sh   # enable+start timers
sudo /usr/local/bin/sentrylab/stop.sh    # disable all timers
```
Suggested cadences (edit timers if needed):
- Passive: every 3–5 minutes
- Active: 15–30 minutes (or daily for SMART)
- Discovery: at boot or when sensor set changes

## Uninstall
```bash
cd SentryLab-PVE
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
The uninstaller will:
1. Run `stop.sh` to disable and stop all services/timers
2. Remove any systemd units from `/etc/systemd/system/` that weren't properly cleaned up
3. Remove all scripts from `/usr/local/bin/sentrylab/`
4. Ask if you want to delete the backup/export directory (`/var/lib/sentrylab/`)
5. Remind you to manually remove the config file if desired: `/usr/local/etc/sentrylab.conf`

## MQTT Topics (proxmox/<HOST>)
- `system`: load/uptime/memory/storage summary
- `temp`: NVMe temps
- `wear`: NVMe wear metrics
- `health`: NVMe SMART health
- `zfs`: pool health/usage
- `disks`: non-ZFS usage
- `availability`: online/offline heartbeat

### Topic Examples

| Metric | Topic | Payload Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU Load | `proxmox/<host>/system/load` | `0.35` |
| Uptime | `proxmox/<host>/system/uptime_sec` | `86400` |
| NVMe Temp | `proxmox/<host>/temp/nvme0` | `42.1` |
| NVMe Wear | `proxmox/<host>/wear/nvme0_wearout` | `3` |
| NVMe Health | `proxmox/<host>/health/nvme0_media_errors` | `0` |
| ZFS Pool | `proxmox/<host>/zfs/<pool>` | `{ "health": "ONLINE", "alloc": 123456789, "free": 987654321 }` |
| Non-ZFS Disks | `proxmox/<host>/disks` | `{ "sda_size_bytes": 512110190592, "sda_free_bytes": 135239876608, ... }` |
| Availability | `proxmox/<host>/availability` | `online` |

## Home Assistant
- MQTT Discovery is published by `discovery.sh` to `homeassistant/` (or `HA_BASE_TOPIC`).
- If HA does not show the device, restart the MQTT integration or HA to consume retained configs, then run an active/passive cycle to publish states.

## ESPHome (Witty Cloud)
- Use `esphome/sentrylab-witty.yaml` with your `secrets.yaml` (wifi, API, OTA keys).
- Set `nas_hostname` to match `HOST_NAME` in `sentrylab.conf`.
- LED logic: ZFS alert = red/blue blink; CPU temp drives green/orange/red; off when cool.

## Hardware Mapping (CSV)
- Discovery exports land in `/var/lib/sentrylab/exports/` for NVMe/ZFS maps.
- Use them to script HA dashboards or for quick inventory.
